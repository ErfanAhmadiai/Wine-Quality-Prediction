# About this dataset
The data was downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).
